## Description
In this project, we implemented a conflict resolution protocol for network congestion using discrete event simulation.

We developed a congestion control algorithm based on TCP Reno to prevent data loss due to buffer saturation in the network. The algorithm includes a congestion window variable and a threshold that dynamically adjusts based on the network load. Additionally, we established bidirectional communication between nodes to control the flow of data and reduce the transmission rate in case of congestion at the receiver.

The main objective was to investigate how these protocols can improve network performance in terms of congestion reduction and data loss prevention. To achieve this, we conducted experiments using simulations to evaluate the performance of the implemented algorithm.

## Results
We collected data on network congestion, data loss, and flow performance through the simulations conducted. The results showed a significant improvement in congestion reduction and data loss reduction when using the implemented conflict resolution protocol.
